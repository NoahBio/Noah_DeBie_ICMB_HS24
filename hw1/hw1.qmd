This assignment is the result of a process that started with much skepticism about it's feasability but (touch wood) seems to be nearing its end (Edit: 3 hours later: *It was not so*).

```{r}
# Load the iris dataset

data(iris)

# Create a scatterplot

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
col = iris$Species,
pch = 19,
main = "Iris Sepal Length vs Width",
xlab = "Sepal Length",
ylab = "Sepal Width")

# Add a legend

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species),
col = 1:3, pch = 19, title = "Species")
```
